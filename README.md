# HourlyNotifier
This is a program that notifies the user with a sound, every time an hour change happens.

I programmed this to help myself with losing track of time when I'm on the computer (I have autism, so that's one of the reasons why)

## How it works
After starting it up, a command-line window should open with a lower "C" beep sound playing. That sound is normal: It indicates the program has officially started.

There's a few controls to put in mind:

CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + N + M: Hides the program, so it won't be in the way while you do whatever. Press the same combination to show the window again at anytime.
ESC: Closes the program. You'll need to have the window focused (a.k.a. the window has been clicked by your mouse and is the main window highlight of your OS) before closing it.

## Future goals
Planning on having customizable features, like custom sound settings and all that, but right now the program will stay as-is until I officially decide those will be added in the future.
